1. Windows 95/98/NT

	1.1. Microsoft DirectX

	Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun is a Microsoft DirectX application. 
	Version 6.0 of Microsoft DirectX is included on the CD and you have 
	the option to install it when Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun is 
	installed.

	Under some early versions of Windows 95, DirectX 6.0 cannot be 
	installed directly from the Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun installer.  
	If this occurs, please run DXSetup.exe located on the CD in the 
	DXSetup folder.
 
	All Microsoft DirectX drivers are located in the DXSetup folder off of 
	the root of the CD. To reinstall the Microsoft DirectX drivers go into 
	the DXSetup folder and run DXSetup.exe. You can explore the CD by 
	choosing the "Explore the CD" option in the AutoPlay title screen.
	If you have difficulty running Windows 95/98 after these new Microsoft 
	DirectX drivers have been installed, please contact your local 
	Microsoft subsidiary, or write:

		Microsoft Customer Sales and Service,
		One Microsoft Way,
		Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA

		USA telephone: 1-800-426-9400
		International telephone: ++1-206-882-8080

	1.2. Microsoft Office Toolbar

	If you make use of this feature of Microsoft Office and it appears 
	over the game screen when playing Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun you 
	will have to disable the Office Toolbar before playing.

	1.3. Windows NT 4.0

	Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun requires Service Pack 3 or later 
	versions to be installed in order to work with Windows NT 4.0.   
	Please contact your computer manufacturer if you need to get Service 
	Pack 3.


2. Troubleshooting

	2.1. Known Video Card Problems.

	Video monitor settings may need to be adjusted after installing the 
	Microsoft DirectX video drivers.  If you screen distorts, or is 
	shifted horizontally or vertically, you can return it to normal by 
	adjusting the controls on your monitor.  

	Most video display problems can be corrected by installing the latest 
	drivers for your particular card. Please consult your video card 
	documentation for details on how to get the latest drivers for your card. 

	If you cannot use the "Stretch to fit option" this most likely means 
	that your video card does not support this feature.

	If you are using the Microsoft Theme Pack and have selected a custom 
	cursor, video corruption can occur.  For best results, please use 
	default cursors while playing Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun.

	2.2. Known Sound Card Problems.

	Old SoundBlaster AWE 64 and AWE 32 sound card drivers can cause 
	skipping and repeating sound that may cause your computer to run 
	Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun much slower than normal.  If you have 
	one of these sound cards and are experiencing these symptoms, please 
	contact your card manufacturer for latest drivers.

	Audio may stutter on certain systems running Windows NT.  To correct 
	this problem you must install the latest audio driver for your sound card.

	Most sound card problems can be corrected by installing the latest 
	drivers for your particular card.  Please consult your sound card 
	documentation for details on how to get the latest drivers.

	If you are using USB speakers, do not turn off the speakers during gameplay.  
	Doing so may cause the game to crash.

	2.3. Known DirectX Problems

	If another application is using the sound card while trying to install 
	or run the game, a "DXSound Error" will appear.  If this error occurs, 
	please close all applications and run the install or game again.

	2.4. Virtual Memory Settings

	Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun may need to use more RAM than is present 
	on your system. Windows 95/98 automatically takes care of this by using 
	what is known as "Virtual Memory" - which uses space on your hard disk 
	to simulate the memory it needs and swaps data back and forth from your 
	hard disk as required. Windows 95/98 allows you to manually set the amount 
	of hard drive space it uses for Virtual Memory: WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT 
	YOU DO NOT DO THIS! To let Windows 95/98 manage the Virtual Memory, go to 
	the Windows 95/98 start menu, select 'settings\control panel', then 
	double-click 'system', click 'performance\file system\virtual memory' 
	and then select 'Let Windows manage my virtual memory settings 
	(recommended).'

	2.5. Known System RAM problems

	Certain systems contain video cards that use system memory as video memory.  
	With these systems, it is possible that Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun will 
	not run properly if you have only 32MB of memory.  Since the video card uses 
	system memory, usually 4MB or 8MB, on 32MB machines there is not enough 
	memory left to run the game.  In order for Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun 
	to run properly you will need to increase your system memory or use a video 
	card with dedicated video RAM.

	2.6. AutoPlay.

	If your CD does not AutoPlay when inserted in the drive, you may have this 
	feature disabled. To Enable AutoPlay, right click on 'My Computer' and 
	select 'Properties' then 'Device Manager'. Select your CD-ROM drive and 
	click 'Properties'. Select 'Settings' and check the 'Auto insert 
	notification' box.

	2.7. 16 bit CD-ROM drivers

	Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun may fail to start if there is a 16 bit 
	CD-ROM driver loaded from the AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS. If you have 
	references to MSCDEX or equivalent drivers then try removing them from 
	your autoexec.bat and config.sys files. Windows 95/98 does not generally 
	need these drivers to work and in most cases will actually perform better 
	without them.

	2.8. CD-Changers and Multi-Drivers

	Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun does not support multiple CD-ROM drives or 
	CD-changers and assumes that you only have one CD-ROM drive.  If you have 
	more than one CD-ROM drive, you should insert the Command & Conquer 
	Tiberian Sun CD in the first CD drive letter.  For example, if you have 
	CD drives E:, F: and G:, your Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun CD should 
	be inserted into the E: drive.

	2.9. Choppy movie performance

	If you find that the movie performance is choppy or jerky, try reducing 
	the Windows 95/98 CD caching by going to the Start/Settings/Control Panel 
	and double-clicking the System applet. In the System Properties dialog, 
	click the Performance tab and then click the File System button. From 
	the File System Properties dialog, click the CD-ROM tab and note the 
	Supplemental Cache Size setting (so that you can reset the cache size if 
	need be). Now set the Supplemental Cache Size to Small. This should have 
	a marked effect on movie performance.

	2.10. Power Saving Modes

	It is possible that your computer loses connection to your ISP due to long 
	periods of inactivity. Sometimes this is caused by the sleep mode in your 
	"Power Saving" options. This can cause problems during game play or when 
	connected to Westwood Online. To avoid any problems please disable your 
	screen saver or power-saving modes when running the game.
	
	2.11.	 Periodic Slowdowns 
		
	If periodic slowdowns occur while playing Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun 
	while the CD is being accessed, it is most likely due to music being 
	played from the CD.  If this occurs, please reinstall Command & Conquer 
	Tiberian Sun and install the music files onto the hard drive.  This will 
	greatly reduce the slowdowns on CD access.

	If periodic slowdowns occur while playing Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun 
	and the CD is not being accessed please insure that there are no other 
	applications running during your game session.  This includes anti-virus 
	software.

	2.12.	 Game Updates and Patches
		
	Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun contains an auto-updating feature. Updated 
	versions of the game will be announced to you when playing Command & Conquer 
	Tiberian Sun on Westwood Online. When an updated version of the game is 
	available you will be able to receive it and automatically have it 
	installed, if you wish. If you do not intend to play Command & Conquer 
	Tiberian Sun on Westwood Online then please check HTTP://www.westwood.com 
	for update information.

3.	Gameplay Issues

	3.1. Engineers

	Engineers can be placed in Guard mode, like any other unit.  When in guard 
	mode, engineers automatically heal any nearby player owned structures that 
	are damaged into the red or capture nearby enemy buildings.
